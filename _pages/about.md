I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Paris Brain Institute, currently working in the ARAMIS Lab under the supervision of Ninon Burgos and Olivier Colliot. My research focuses on developing and applying deep learning generative methods for medical imaging, with a specific interest in diffusion models for anomaly detection in neuroimaging.

I combine methodological innovation in generative models and anomaly detection techniques with a strong focus on clinical applications, aiming to improve diagnostic tools and patient outcomes in the case neurodegenerative disease. I'm also an active contributor to open-source projects, further advancing the field of medical AI.

I earned my PhD in computer science from Sorbonne University in April 2024, and I hold an engineering degree from Ecole Centrale de Lyon and a master in data science from Université de Lyon 1.

When I’m not working on AI or medical imaging, you’ll often find me playing soccer or riding my gravel bike!
