I am a doctoral candidate at Aramis Lab in the Paris Brain Institute under the supervision of Ninon Burgos and Olivier Colliot. My main topic of research is the use of deep learning methods for medical imaging computing. More specifically I work with deep generative models for anomaly detection on neuroimages.

My research focus on methodological development of generative models and anomaly detection technics as well as their clinical applications. I am also strongly implicated in open source projects.

Graduated from Ecole Centrale de Lyon and Université de Lyon 1 in 2020, I have a computer science background. My expected PhD graduation time at Sorbonne University is Spring 2024.

I also love kicking balls (aka playing soccer) and riding bikes !
